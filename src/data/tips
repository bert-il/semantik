<h3>7. Diagram size</h3>

<h3>8. Diagram editor</h3>
<p>
The application called "semantik-d" can be used to create diagrams individually. The diagrams can be imported or exported from the diagram view of semantik.
Additionally, the diagrams can be exported to a variety of formats by using the command-line. Just specify the extension, and a diagram will be produced if it is supported:
<pre>semantik-d /tmp/foo.semd -o /tmp/foo.svg</pre>
The options &quot;--width&quot; and &quot;--height&quot; can be used to change the size of png files.

<h3>9. Know thyself</h3>
<p>
"Know thyself and you will know the Universe and the Gods" may be one the best joke ever told.
There is no knowledge without an observer, therefore knowledge is always about oneself.
And since observers are indissociable from universe, all the knowledge is about the universe itself.
As the whole universe is observing itself through you, all your knowledge - gathered or desired - is just the illusion of your self.

<h3>10. Use the appropriate views</h3>
<p>
<i>Will the recipient of the information understand what is meant?</i> Since listening requires an effort, do your best to entertain the reader, or to avoid obliterating him at least.
</p>
<p>
If the data that you need to present is a tree, use a map. If the data is tabular in nature, use a table. If it is a graph, make a diagram.
And if a picture is the best illustration, make one.

<h3>11. All models are wrong</h3>
<p>
Once a document is created, it is difficult to start over. Why do not we make a single map of everything like Wikipedia for example?
</p>
<p>
Consider the following:
<ol>
  <li>All model are partial. An infinite amount of models can be created to describe something, as each model will have an observer with a particular point of view.</li>
  <li>The model is not the actual <i>thing</i> - the map is not the territory - this is the fallacy of reification.</li>
  <li>A model gets out of sync extremely fast. This is why temperature regulators are always wrong.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The truth lies in its permanent discovery, so the past mindmaps are always subject to re-work.
Knowledge is therefore more a process than something that might be worth accumulating.

<h3>12. We become what we think</h3>
<p>
We create models, and such models are limited. Yet we are using them for decision making and once they are accepted, we are reluctant to question them.
Questioning requires time and effort. The best approach may be in questioning the information before assuming it is true.
</p>
<p>
It is often believed that the best way to control the masses is through the emotions, for example advertisement may create desire, or political speeches may create fear. Yet, the key lies in controlling people thoughts because new thoughts will be built upon them and the resulting actions will be biased. For instance, advertisement actually works by giving consumers a reference frame in which the products are familiar.
</p>
<p>
This can be used for the right or the wrong purposes. For example, learning about mathematical symbols provides a vocabulary that can help with solving difficult problems. Teaching children bad words or racial slurs provides them with tools to hurt others later on.

<h3>13. Question everything</h3>
<p>
While it is usually counter-productive to question one's perceptions, one should try to refine and contrast them. What is the intensity of the sensation for example? Does it have a taste or a color? What is the smell of <i>fear</i>?
</p>
<p>
Thoughts are models that reside in memory, and they become foundations for future thought through analogy and comparison for example. Therefore, they should always be questioned and controlled to understand their limits.

<h3>14. Pay attention to what you feel</h3>
<p>
Sometimes simple models can lead to a tremendous amount of pain and suffering. Here are a few great ones:
<ol>
  <li>Writing more tests helps making the code bug-free.<li>
  <li>Obesity problems can be fixed by encouraging people to do more exercise.</li>
  <li>If bad things happen, it is because people are not virtuous enough; more prayers will solve all the problems.</li>
</ol>
A common point in these models is that - besides being useless and ineffective except for a few - they require an unreasonable amount of effort and energy. They will be advertised by a vocal minority with an above-the-average amount of energy, and make everyone else feel guilty about them. They will also prevent people from pursuing more efficient solutions such as using safe programming languages, introducing regulations on sugar addition, and promoting welfare and education.
</p>

<p>
Another example is fear of death. As we grow up, we gain the concept of <i>impermanence</i>, that things change all the time in an irreversible manner. Then we add on top of this the concepts of <i>alive</i> and <i>dead</i> despite the fact that those concepts do not have a solid biological basis. Then we add to that the idea of <i>uniqueness</i> of life, that we are the only planet in the universe and the only intelligent beings capable of feeling and thought (though in an infinite universe, there will be repetitions, and we may have twins somewhere, albeit very far). And then something magic happens, despite the lack of proof for the concepts enumerated previously, we just suddenly became anxious and worried about the future.
</p>

<p>
Feelings of unease, of fear or of guilt are there to show us our state of contradiction, which means that our thoughts and our models need rework. Pay close attention to them when creating mindmaps.
