Priority:
---------

z-index in diagrams
tabbed gui for diagram library
svg export?
class diagrams
crossing diagram arrows for the one with higher z-index
s5 default picture size?
crash: resize a box, unselect the diagram, then undo?
display pictures on the canvas...

Import kdissert documents properly
Serialize undo operations
