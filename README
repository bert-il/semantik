-----------------------------------------------

1. Compiling and installing:

First, make sure that you have a Linux(tm) system (a *BSD system should do it too)
* the KDE4 development packages must be installed (KDE4 >= beta4)
* the Qt development packages must be installed (Qt >= 4.3)

To compile, run:
./waf configure
./waf

Then run the following installation command as root (important - Semantik will only work if installed):
./waf install

The generic command for creating a package is the following (packagers):
./waf configure clean build --prefix=/usr && DESTDIR=$fakeroot ./waf install

-----------------------------------------------

2. Getting started:

* double-click to add an item
* when a leaf is selected, type 'enter' to start in-place editing, type 'enter' again to save
* left,right,up,down keys to navigate in the tree
* alt+left,right,up,down keys to move the selection around
* double-click on a leaf to add a ramification
* double-click on a link with the control key held to disconnect

Getting started with document generators:
* look at the scripts in src/templates/
* the naming is used for finding the files

Getting started with the diagrams:
* in the map view, right click on a map item, and select "data type: diagram"
* now in the "data" dock widget, double-click to add a diagram item (or right click...)
* when holding the control key pressed and left-clicking on a diagram item, a connection arrow is created
* when holding the control key pressed, double-clicking on a connection thread deletes it

-----------------------------------------------

3. Document generators:

* Be careful with documents that you have not created yourself, there are no security restrictions at the moment
* The document generation is performed in two steps: variable substitution and preprocessing
* Variables in the form @var_name@ are replaced by the corresponding document variables
* The core of the document is a variable itself
* A c-like preprocessor is then run on the resulting document, using (nested) conditionals such as:
  #if 0, #if !0, #ifdef var, #endif (the #elif construct is not supported yet)
* External viewers can be used, from the 'variables' panel, add code in the form
  'command_'+template_name=command_line, for example:

  command_html=kfmclient newTab %s
  command_odt=oowriter %s
  command_s5=firefox %s

  this is only necessary for documents that do not have a KDE mapping for opening them
* LaTeX commands can be inserted by using all_latex=1

-----------------------------------------------

4. Licensing:

GPL V3

Semantik does not Endorse non-free systems:

- Due to restrictive Debian policies regarding "binary" files, Semantik cannot be
packaged on it. Fortunately, there are less restrictive Linux distributions around.

- Do not port Semantik to proprietary platforms (Windows, Mac). You may be free
to do it, but the author is also free to stop the development, or to keep the
next versions for himself.

-----------------------------------------------

Enjoy Semantik
