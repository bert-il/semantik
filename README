-----------------------------------------------

1. Compiling and installing:

First, make sure that you have a Linux(tm) system (a *BSD system should do it too)
* the KDE4 development packages must be installed (KDE4 >= beta4)
* the Qt development packages must be installed (Qt >= 4.3)

To compile, run:
./waf configure
./waf

Then run the following installation command as root (important - Semantik will only work if installed):
./waf install

To execute Semantik right from the source directory (developers):
./waf --exe

The generic command for creating a package is the following (packagers):
./waf configure --prefix=/usr; ./waf; DESTDIR=$fakeroot ./waf install

-----------------------------------------------

2. Getting started:

* double-click to add an item
* when a leaf is selected, type 'enter' to start in-place editing, type 'enter' again to leave
* left,right,up,down keys to navigate in the tree
* alt+left,right,up,down keys to move the selection around
* double-click on a leaf to add a ramification
* double-click on a link with the control key held to disconnect

Getting started with document generators:
* look at the scripts in src/templates/
* the naming is used for finding the files, be careful

Getting started with the diagrams:
* in the map view, right click on a map item, and select "data type: diagram"
* now in the "data" dock widget, double-click to add a diagram item
* when holding the control key pressed and left-clicking on a diagram item, a connection arrow is created
* when holding the control key pressed, double-clicking on a connection thread deletes it

-----------------------------------------------

3. Document generators:

* the document generation is performed in two steps: variable substitution and preprocessing
* variables in the form @var_name@ are replaced by the corresponding document variables
* the core of the document is a variable itself
* a c-like preprocessor is then run on the resulting document, using (nested) conditionals such as:
  #if 0, #if !0, #ifdef var, #endif (the #elif construct is not supported yet)
* external viewers can be used, from the 'variables' panel, add code in the form
  'command_'+template_name=command_line, for example:

  command_html=kfmclient newTab %s
  command_odt=oowriter %s
  command_s5=firefox %s

  this is only necessary for documents that do not have a kde component yet
